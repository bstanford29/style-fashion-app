# Dressy

## Description
A playful dress-up game for kids ages 5-10 where children can drag and drop clothing onto a character that fits perfectly using pre-rendered layers. Pure sandbox experience with runway celebrations and outfit saving.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Kids Want Creative Expression
Children love playing dress-up but digital options often feel limiting with static paper-doll overlays. Dressy provides satisfying drag-and-drop interactions with clothes that fit perfectly on the character, making outfit creation feel magical and responsive.

### Problem 2: Frustrating Unlock Systems
Many kids games lock content behind progress walls, leading to frustration. Dressy offers pure sandbox play - all ~30-40 clothing items are available immediately so kids can create freely without barriers.

### Problem 3: Limited Representation
Kids want to see themselves in the characters they dress. Dressy includes 4-5 skin tone variants so every child can play with a character that looks like them.

### Problem 4: No Reward for Creativity
Creating an outfit should feel special. Dressy celebrates completions with a runway animation (spin, sparkles, confetti), then lets kids save to a gallery and download images to share with parents.

### Problem 5: Safety Concerns with Sharing
Parents worry about social features in kids apps. Dressy keeps sharing simple and safe - download an image that parents can then share however they choose. No social features, no accounts, no moderation needed.
